# Research Findings: StockHero Clone

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Feature**: Automated Trading Bot Platform

## Research Areas

### 1. TradingView Widget Integration

**Decision**: Use TradingView Charting Library and Datafeed API
**Rationale**:
- Free tier provides 15-minute delayed data for US markets
- Proven, reliable charting solution used by major platforms
- Rich technical indicators built-in (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages)
- Responsive and performant for web applications

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Alpha Vantage API: Limited free tier, requires custom charting
- Yahoo Finance API: Unreliable, no official support
- Chart.js with custom data: More development overhead

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use TradingView Widget for chart display
- Integrate TradingView Datafeed API for historical and real-time data
- Cache data locally to minimize API calls

### 2. Next.js Single Project Architecture

**Decision**: Next.js 14 with App Router and API Routes (single project)
**Rationale**:
- Simple single project structure
- API routes handle all backend logic
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Local deployment only
- Minimal configuration needed

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate frontend/backend: Too complex for local application
- Vue.js + Nuxt.js: Less ecosystem support
- Plain React SPA: No built-in API support

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use App Router for better performance and developer experience
- Implement API routes for bot management, trading logic, and data processing
- Use Server Components for static content, Client Components for interactive features

### 3. Database Design for Trading Data

**Decision**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
**Rationale**:
- SQLite perfect for single-user local application
- Zero configuration database
- Prisma provides type-safe database access
- Sufficient performance for 2-3 bots

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PostgreSQL: Overkill for local single-user app
- MongoDB: Too complex for simple use case
- In-memory storage: Data persistence issues

**Implementation Notes**:
- Design optimized schema for time-series trade data
- Use database indexes for fast price/time queries
- Implement proper backup and migration strategies

### 4. Trading Bot Engine

**Decision**: Simple polling-based architecture
**Rationale**:
- 1-minute polling intervals sufficient for paper trading
- Simpler than WebSocket implementation
- Easier to debug and maintain
- Adequate for 2-3 concurrent bots

**Alternatives Considered**:
- WebSockets: Too complex for requirements
- Server-sent events: Still requires persistent connections
- Long polling: Unnecessary complexity

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use setInterval for polling market data
- Simple async/await patterns for bot execution
- Basic error handling and retry logic

### 5. Technical Analysis Libraries

**Decision**: Custom implementation of core indicators with validation against established libraries
**Rationale**:
- Full control over calculation logic
- Better understanding of indicator behavior
- Ability to optimize for specific use cases
- Educational value for trading strategy development

**Alternatives Considered**:
- TradingView Pine Script: Limited to TradingView platform
- TA-Lib: C library, complex Node.js integration
- Third-party npm packages: Quality and maintenance concerns

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implement RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages
- Validate calculations against known datasets
- Design for extensibility to add more indicators

### 6. Risk Management and Portfolio Tracking

**Decision**: Real-time position tracking with configurable risk limits
**Rationale**:
- Essential for automated trading safety
- Prevents catastrophic losses from bot malfunctions
- Industry standard risk management practices
- User confidence in automated systems

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Post-trade risk analysis: Too late to prevent losses
- Manual risk monitoring: Defeats automation purpose
- Simple stop-losses only: Insufficient for complex strategies

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implement position sizing algorithms
- Real-time P&L calculation
- Configurable stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Portfolio-level risk limits

## Technical Stack Validation

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 14**: Latest stable version with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Basic type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Simple utility-first CSS framework
- **Native fetch**: Simple data fetching with polling

### Backend Stack
- **Next.js API Routes**: Simple API endpoints
- **Prisma**: Database ORM with type generation
- **SQLite**: Local database
- **Polling**: Data updates every minute

### Trading Stack
- **TradingView API**: Market data and charting
- **Custom Trading Engine**: Bot execution and management
- **Technical Analysis**: Custom indicator implementations
- **Risk Management**: Position and portfolio monitoring

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Requirements
- Dashboard updates: <500ms
- Trade execution simulation: <1000ms
- Chart rendering: <2000ms
- API response times: <200ms

### Scalability Factors
- Single-user local application only
- 2-3 concurrent bots maximum
- 1000+ historical trades storage
- Polling-based data processing

### Memory and Storage
- Client-side state management for UI responsiveness
- Database optimization for time-series queries
- Efficient data structures for technical analysis calculations
- Local caching strategy for market data

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- No real financial credentials stored (paper trading focus)
- API key management for external services
- Input validation for all user data
- Secure session management

### Trading Safety
- Paper trading mode only
- Position size limits and validation
- Basic stop-loss mechanisms

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Next.js project setup with TypeScript
2. Database schema design and Prisma setup
3. Basic UI components and layout
4. TradingView integration

### Phase 2: Trading Engine
1. Bot creation and management system
2. Technical analysis implementation
3. Paper trading simulation
4. Real-time dashboard updates

### Phase 3: Polish
1. Basic performance tracking
2. Simple trade history
3. Bot status monitoring

All research findings support the technical decisions made in the feature specification and provide a solid foundation for implementation planning.
