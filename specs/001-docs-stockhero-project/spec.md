## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an individual trader, I want to create and manage automated trading bots that can execute trades based on technical analysis, so I can automate my trading strategy while maintaining control over risk management and performance monitoring.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I access the bot creation interface, **Then** I can create a new trading bot through a guided wizard process
2. **Given** I have created a bot, **When** I configure its trading strategy parameters, **Then** the bot can execute paper trades according to my specifications
3. **Given** my bot is running, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I can see real-time performance metrics, current positions, and trade history
4. **Given** I am monitoring multiple bots (up to 2-3), **When** market conditions change, **Then** I can quickly adjust bot parameters or pause/resume bot operations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when market data feeds become unavailable during trading hours?
- How does the system handle bot conflicts when multiple bots try to trade the same asset simultaneously?
- What occurs when a bot's strategy parameters would result in trades exceeding the user's risk limits?
- How does the system behave during market closures or holidays?
